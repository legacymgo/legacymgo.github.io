# LegacyMGO

LegacyMGO is a 24/7 "room" for Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence Online, known to as MGO1 (Metal Gear Online 1) or simply MGO. The 24/7 room initiative plans to make life easier for more casual or easygoing players, where they don't have to awkwardly ask around for games - they just hop into LegacyMGO and play. 

# Features:

• 99% uptime 

• Will be hosted on good speeds (360mbps internet)

# FAQ

Q: When will it be out?
A: TheMrIron2 will be buying a second PS2 solely for LegacyMGO around his birthday, November 14. Expect for some big news updates in November and even some alpha testing for those who are willing to participate (password locked and being played on in private for the first few days) to make sure everything is okay. Then we release it into the wild for a week long open beta run, and if all goes to plan the server should "officially" debut in December.

Q: How can I contact TheMrIron2 about LegacyMGO?
A: Your best shot at contacting the man behind the project, TheMrIron2, is through Discord. He is in the SaveMGO community - if you have any questions fire away at him

Q: Is this all a one man effort?
A: Far from it - this wouldn't be possible without the support of the SaveMGO community and their help. TheMrIron2 would like to thank everybody who played a role in this project, no matter how big (website coding, HoodlumDTX) (player handling, Funey) or how small (many people giving feedback) every one of you is appreciated!

Q: Big Boss or Solid Snake?
A: The original is always the best. Clones can never be as good (Solid is awesome in his own way though) ;)

Q: Can I donate to you guys to help keep it running?
A: Assuming the room has 100% uptime - no breaks, 12 months straight - it would cost ~€30 per year. Will that sound like a steep price over time? Yes, but we won't be accepting donations. Why not? Because the SaveMGO team who spearheaded the MGO revival did not ask for nor accept a single donation, and we feel it would be wrong to ask for donations as we are just a part of the entire SaveMGO server. We thank you for understanding.

Q: Do you plan to do something similar for MGO2?
A: No - we haven't even thought about it due to how expensive a PS3 solely as a room would be. Even if money was no object there are still plenty of players on SaveMGO2 - remember, this was primarily created to help to easy any hassle out of MGO1, and there's almost always a game on MGO2 anyway so it's unnecessary.


Q: MGO3?
A: Don't even think about it.
